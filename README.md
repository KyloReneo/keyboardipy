# keyboardipy
A virtual keyboard that i made with python when my laptops keyboard was not working properly.

 ## how to run:
 open the terminal and go to the /keyboardipy/keyboardipy directory and run the program:
      
      python3 keyboardipy.py

## how to use:
just click on the buttens and write what ever you want to write and finally click the "copy" butten
to copy the written line into the clipboard. 
now every thing is copied to the clipboard and you can paste it every where you want.
don't forget to click on the "clean" butten every time you want to write somthing new.

- ### This virtual keyboard supports English & Persian.
