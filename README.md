# keyboardipy
A virtual keyboard that i made with python when my laptops keyboard was not working properly.

 ## how to run:
 open the terminal and go to the /keyboardipy/keyboardipy directory and run the program:
      
      python3 keyboardipy.py

## how to use:
just click the buttens and write what ever you want and press copy butten at the end 
to copy the written line into the clipboard. 
now every thing is copied to the clipboard and you can paste it every where you want.
don't forget to press clean butten every time you want to write somthing new.
